/**
 * BleKeyboardHost
 *
 * Scans for a BLE HID keyboard, connects, subscribes to Input Report
 * characteristics, logs reports, and (in the .cpp) forwards key events
 * into LVGL via a keypad input device.
 *
 * Usage:
 *   BleKeyboardHost keyboard;
 *   keyboard.begin();                            // sets up BLE + LVGL keypad indev
 *   keyboard.connect(callback, 500); // subscribe & start notifications
 *
 *   // Periodically:
 *   keyboard.pollLogs();                         // prints buffered logs to Serial
 *
 * Public helper:
 *   static char hidToAscii(uint8_t keycode, bool shift);
